# Planning docs — gr0k-dm

This folder contains planning artifacts for the Unity migration (Windows-first, multiplayer-first).

Files:
- UNITY_MIGRATION_PLAN.md — high-level plan, architecture, milestones
- PROTOTYPE_BACKLOG.md — 8–12 week sprint backlog with acceptance criteria
- API_CONTRACT.md — WebSocket JSON contract between Unity client and Express/ws server
- TIMELINE_AND_ESTIMATES.md — effort, cost considerations, next steps

Suggested usage:
- Keep this folder in the repo as a single source of truth for the migration plan.
- Link sprint tasks from these docs into your project board or issues.
- If you want, I can convert backlog items into GitHub issues or open a PR with these files added.
