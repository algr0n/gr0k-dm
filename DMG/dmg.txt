 Not all divine powers need to be derived from deities.

 power from that conviction. In other campaigns,            '
 impersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods
 by granting power to mortals attuned to them. Just as
 druids and rangers can gain their spell ability from the
 force of nature rather than from a specific nature deity,
 some clerics devote themselves to ideals rather than to
 a god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and
 chivalry rather than a specific deity.
   Forces and philosophies aren't worshiped; they aren't
 beings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept
 sacrifices. Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn't
 necessarily exclusive of service to a deity. A person can
 be devoted to the philosophy of good and offer worship
 to various good deities, or revere the force of nature
 and also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might
 be seen as personal manifestations of an impersonal
 force. In a world that includes deities with demonstrable
 power (through their clerics), it's unusual for a
 philosophy to deny the existence of deities, although a
 common philosophical belief states that the deities are
 more like mortals than they would have mortals believe.
 According to such philosophies, the gods aren't truly
 immortal (just very long-lived), and mortals can attain
 divinity. In fact, ascending to godhood is the ultimate
 goal of some philosophies.                        .
   The power of a philosophy stems from the belief that
 mortals invest in it. A philosophy that only one person
 believes in isn't strong enough to bestow magical power

 HUMANOIDS AND THE GODS
  When it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider
  range of beliefs and institutions than other races do. In
  many D&D settings, orcs, elves, dwarves, goblins, and
  other humanoids have tight pantheons. It is expected
  that an ore will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of
  subordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces
  a staggering variety of deities. Each human culture
  might have its own array of gods.

     CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN
I4
SETTLEMENTS
T he places where people live-bustling cities,
prosperous towns, and tiny villages nestled among
miles of farmland- help define the nature of civilization
in your world. A single settlement- a home base for
your adventurers- is a great place to start a campaign
and begin your world building. Consider the following
questions as you create any settlement in your world:
  What purpose does it serve in your game?
  How big is it? Who lives there?
  What does it look, smell, a-nd sound like?
  Who governs it? Who else holds power? Is it part
  of a larger state?
  What are its defenses?
• Where do characters go to find the goods and services
  they need?
• What temples and other organizations feature
  prominently?
• What fantastic elements distinguish it from an
  ordinary town?
  Why should the characters care about the settlement?
The guidelines in this section are here to help you build
the settlement you want for whatever purpose you have
in mind. Disregard any advice here that runs counter to
your vision for a settlement.

PURPOSE
A settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story
and fun of your campaign. Other than that point, the
settlement's purpose determines the amount of detail
you put into it. Create only the features of a settlement
that you know you'll need, along with notes on general
features . Then allow the place to grow organically as the
adventurers interact with more and more of it, keeping
notes on new places you invent.

LOCAL COLOR
A settlement might serve as a place where the
characters stop to rest and to buy supplies. A settlement
of this sort needs no more than a brief description.
Include the settlement's name, decide how big it is,
add a dash of flavor ("The smell of the local tanneries
never lifts from this town"), and let the adventurers get
on with their business. The history of the inn where
the characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the
shopkeeper they buy supplies from-you can add this
level of detail, but you don't have to. If the characters
return to the same settlement, start adding these local
features so that it begins to feel a little more like a home
base , albeit a temporary one. Let the settlement develop
as the need arises.

HOME BASE
A settlement gives the adventurers a place to live,
train, and recuperate between adventures. An entire
campaign can center on a particular town or city.
Such a settlement is the launching pad from which the
characters go out into the wider world.
  Designed well, a home base can hold a special place
in the adventurers' hearts, particularly if they care about
one or more NPCs who live there.
   To make a home base come alive, you'll need to
invest some time fl eshing out details, but the players
can help you with that work. Ask them to tell you a bit
abou t mentors, family members, and other important
people in their characters' lives. Feel free to add to and
modify what they give you , but you'll start with a solid
foundation of the non player characters (NPCs) who are
important to the characters. Let the players describe
where and how their characters spend their time- a
favorite tavern, library, or temple, perhaps.
   Using these NPCs and locations as a starting point,
flesh out the settlement's cast of characters. Detail
its leadership, including law enforcement (discussed
later in the chapter). Include characters who can
provide information, such as sages, soothsayers,
librarians, and observant vagabonds. Priests can
provide spellcasting as well as information. Make note
of merchants who might regularly interact with the
adventurers and perhaps compete with one another for
the party's business. Think about the people who run
the adventurers' favorite tavern. And then add a handful
of wild cards: a shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired
mercenary, a drunken rake, or anyone else who adds a
dash of adventure and intrigue to your campaign.

ADVENTURE SITE
A village harboring a secret cult of devil worshipers. A
town controlled by a guild of wererats. A city conquered
by a hobgoblin army. These settlements aren't merely
rest stops but locations where adventures unfold. In
a settlement that doubles as an adventure location,
detail the intended adventure areas, such as towers
and warehouses. For an event-based adventure, note
the NPCs who play a part in the adventure. This
work is adventure preparation as much as it is world
building, and the cast of characters you develop for
your adventure-including allies, patrons, enemies, and
extras- can become recurring figures in your campaign.

SIZE
Most settlements in a D&D world are villages clustered
        a
around larger town or city. Farming villages supply the
town or city population with food in exchange for goods
the farmers can't produce themselves. Towns and cities
are the seats of the nobles who govern the surrounding
area, and who carry the responsibility for defending the
villages from attack. Occasionally, a local lord or lady
lives in a keep or fortress with no nearby town or city.

VILLAGE
Population: Up to about 1,000
Government: A noble (usually not a resident) rules the
 village, with an appointed agent (a reeve) in residence
 to adjudicate disputes and collect taxes.
Defense: The reeve might have a small force of soldiers.
 Otherwise, the village relies on a citizen militia.
Commerce: Basic supplies are readily available,
 possibly from an· inn or a trading post. Other goods
 are available from traveling merchants.
Organizations: A village might contain one or two
 temples or shrines, but few or no other organizations.

CHAPTER 1 I A WORLD OF YOUR OWN
CREATING A CAMPAIGN
The world you create is the stage for the
adventures you set in it. You don't have to give more
thought to it than that. You can run adventures in
an episodic format , with the characters as the only
common element, and also weave themes throughout
those adventures to build a greater saga of the
characters' achievements in the world.
  P lanning an entire campaign might seem like a
daunting task, but you don't have to plot out every
detail right from the start. You can start with the
basics, running a few adventures, and think about
larger plotlines you want to explore as the campaign
progresses. You're free to add as much or as little detail
a you wish.
  T he start of a campaign resembles the start of an
adventure. You want to jump quickly into the action,
 how the players that adventure awaits, and grab
their attention right away. Give the players enough
information to make them want to come back week after

START SMALL

city, town, or village where they start the game, and
perhaps the nearby dungeon. You might decide that
the barony is at war with a nearby duchy, or that a
dista nt forest is crawling with ettercaps and giant
  piders, and you should note these things. But at
the start of the game, the local area is enough to get
the campaign off the ground. Follow these steps to
create that local area:

 revolution. Pick a power group in your current campaign
 and name (or invent) a group that opposes it, fomenting
 revolution. Then let the following points help you flesh
 out the conflict:
   Name three things the rebels want or hope to achieve.
 • The rebels achieve a victory against those they wish
   to overthrow, even if it's a pyrrhic victory. Which of
   their three goals do they achieve? How long is this
   achievement likely to last?
   State the cost exacted upon the old order after its
   fall from power. Does anyone from the former power
   group remain in power during the next regime? If the
   old order remains in power, describe one way that its
   leaders punish the revolutionaries.
 • One of the rebellion's prominent leaders-in some
   respects the face of the revolution- was driven by a
   personal reason for his or her part in events. Describe
   this person and state the true reason he or she led the
   rebellion.
 • What problem existed before the revolution that
   persists in spite of it?

  a species of plant or animal that held an important
  place in the local ecology, or an entire race or culture of
  people. Its absence causes a chain reaction that affects
  every creature that uses or relies on it.

  grand scale, magic dies, the last dragon is slain, or the
  final fey noble departs the world.

       At the other end of the plane. near the Frostfell (the
     plane of ice that borders the Plane of Water), is a region
     of frigid winds called the Mistral Reach. These gales
     drive snowstorms into the Frostfell and away from it,
    .toward the heart of the plane. Earth motes in the reach
     are covered with snow and ice.

    PLANE OF EARTH
I   Earth symbolizes stability, rigidity, stern resolve, and
    tradition. The plane's position opposite the Plane of
    Air in the ring of the Elemental Planes reflects its
    opposition to almost everything air represents.
       The Plane of Earth is a chain of mountains rising
    higher than any mountain range in the Material Plane.
    It has no sun of its own, and no air surrounds the peaks
    of its highest mountains. Most visitors to the plane
    arrive by way of caves and caverns that honeycomb the
    mountains.
       The largest cavern beneath the mountains, called
    the Great Dismal Delve or the Sevenfold Mazework, is
    home to the capital city of the dao, the City ofjewels.
    The dao take great pride in their wealth and send teams
    of slaves across the plane in search of new veins of
    ore and gemstones to exploit. Thanks to their efforts,
    every building and significant object in the city is made
    from precious stones and metals, including the slender
    gemstone-inlaid spires that top most buildings. The city
    is protected by a powerful spell that alerts the entire dao
    population if a visitor steals even a single stone. Theft is
    punishable by death, with punishment extending to the
    thief's relatives.
       The mountains nearest the Fountains of Creation (on
    the Plane of Fire) are called the Furnaces. Lava seeps
    through their caverns, and the air reeks of sulfur. The
    dao have great forges and smelting furnaces here to
    process their ores and shape their precious metals.
       The border region between the planes of Water and
    Earth is a horrid swamp where twisted, gnarled trees
    and thick, stinging vines grow from the dense muck and
    slime. Here and there within the Swamp of Oblivion
    (also called the Plane of Ooze), stagnant lakes and pools
    play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous swarms of
    mosquitoes. The few settlements here consist of wooden
    structures suspended above the muck. Most are built on
    platforms between trees, but a few stand on stilts driven
    deep into the muck. No solid earth underlies the mud
    of the swamp, so houses built on poles eventually sink
    down into it.
       It is said that any object cast into the Swamp of
    Oblivion can't be found again for at least a century. Now
    and then, a desperate soul casts an artifact of power into
    this place, removing it from the multiverse for a time.
    The promise of powerful magic lures adventurers to
    brave the monstrous insects and hags of the swamp in
    search of these treasures.
       The region of the plane nearest the Swamp of
    Oblivion is called the Mud Hills. Landslides constantly
    wear away the slopes of the hills, sending cascades
    of earth and stone into the bottomless swamp. The
    Plane of Earth seems to constantly regenerate the land,
    pushing new hills up as the old ones erode to nothing.
PLANE OF FIRE
Fire represents vibrancy, passion, and change. At
its worst, it is cruel and wantonly destructive, as the
efreet often are, but at its best, fire reflects the light of
inspiration, the warmth of compassion, a nd the flame
of desire.
    A blazing sun hangs at the zenith of a golden sky
above the Plane of Fire, waxing and waning on a
1-l-hour cycle. It ranges from white hot at noon to deep
::-ed at midnight, so the darkest hours of the plane
display a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is nearly
   lin ding. Most business in the City of Brass (see below)
takes place during the darker hours.
    The weather on the plane is marked by fierce winds
and thick ash. Although the air is breathable, creatures
   ot native to the plane must cover their mouths and
eyes to avoid stinging cinders. The efreet use magic to
 ·eep the cinder storms away from the City of Brass,
- ut elsewhere in the plane, the wind is always at least
· lustery and rises to hurricane force during the
    orst storms.
    The heat in the Plane of Fire is compa rable to
a hot desert on the Material Pla ne, and poses a
::imilar threat to travelers (see "Extreme Heat" in
  hapter 5, "Adventure Environme nts"). The deeper
one goes into the plane, the rarer water becomes.
3eyond a point, the plane holds no sources of water,
- travelers must carry their own supplies or produce
    ater by magic.
    The Plane of Fire is dominated by the vast Cinder
     astes, a great expanse of black cinders and embers
    ossed by rivers of lava. Roving bands of salamanders
bartle each other, raid azer outposts, and avoid the
~ reet. Ancient ruins dot the desert- remnants of
:"orgotten civilizations.
    A great range of volcanic mountains called the
Fountains of Creation is home to azers. These rocky
;>eaks curl from the edge of the Pla ne of Earth around
- e Cinder Wastes toward the fiery heart of the plane.
      the edge of the plane, the mountains are also called
    e P la ne of Magma. Fire giants and red dragons
:nake their homes here, as well as creatures from the
   eighboring planes.
    Lava flows through the volcanoes toward the Plane
   f Ai r and pools into a great lava sea, called the Sea
of Fire, sailed by efreet and azers in great brass ships.
  -lands of obsidian and basalt jut up from the sea,
   otted with ancient ruins and the lairs of powerful
::-ed dragons. On the shore of the Sea of Fire stands
the City of Brass.

Perhaps the best-known location in the Inner Planes is
the City of Brass, on the shores of the Sea of Fire. This
i the fabled city of the efreet, and its ornate spires and
metal walls reflect their grandiose and cruel nature.
True to the nature of the Plane of Fire, everything in ,
the city seems alive with dancing flames , reflecting the
.;bra nt energy of the place.
  Adventurers frequently come he re on quests for
.egendary magic. If it's possible to buy magic items at
all . the City of Brass is the most likely place to find any
item for sale, though the price might wei! be more than
gold. The efreet are fond of trad ing in favors , especially
when they have the upper hand in negotiations. Perhap
a magical disease or poison ca n be cured only with
something that must be purchased in the bazaars
of the city.
   The heart of the city is the towering Charcoal
Palace, where the tyrannical sultan of the efreet reigns
supreme, surrounded by efreet nobles and a host of
slaves, guardians, and sycophants.

PLANE OF WATER
The nature of water is to flow, not like the gusting wind
or the leaping flame , but smoothly and steadily. It is the
rhythm of the tide, the nectar of life, the bitter tears of
mourning, and the balm of sympathy and healing. Given
time, it can erode all in its path.
   A warm sun arcs across the sky of the Plane of
Water, seeming to rise and set from within the water
at the visible edge of the horizon . Several times a day,
however, the sky clouds over and releases a deluge
of rain, often accompanied by spectacular shows of
lightning, before clearing up again. At night, a glittering
array of stars and auroras bedecks the sky.
   The Plane of Water is an endless sea, called the Sea
of Worlds, dotted here and there with atolls and islands
that rise up from enormous coral reefs that seem to
stretch forever into the depths. The storms that move
across the sea sometimes create temporary portals
to the Material Plane and draw ships into the Plane
of Water. Surviving vessels from countless worlds
and navies ply these waters with little hope of ever
returning home.
   The weather on the plane is a lesson in extremes.
If the sea isn't calm, it is battered by storms. On rare
oc.c asions, a tremor in the planar firmament sends a
rogue wave sweeping across the plane, swamping entire
islands and driving ships down to the reefs.
   Life flourishes in the upper reaches of the Sea of
Worlds, called the Sea of Light because of the sunlight
filtering down into the water. Aquatic humanoids craft
castles and fortresses in the coral reefs. The marids
are the distant stewards of this region, content to allow
the lesser folk to compete for territory. The nominal
emperor of the marids dwells in the Citadel ofTen
Thousand Pearls, an opulent palace made of coral and
studded with pearls.
   The deeper extents of the plane, where no sunlight
reaches, are called the Darkened Depths. Horrid
creatures dwell here, and the absolute cold and crushing
pressure mean a swift end to creatures accustomed
to the surface or the Sea of Light. Krakens and other
mighty leviathans claim this realm.
  Any land that rises above the surface of the sea is
hotly contested by the few air-breathers that live on the
plane. Fleets of rafts and ships lashed together serve
as solid ground where nothing else is available. Most
natives of the plane never break the surface of the sea
and thus ignore these habitations.
   One of the few actual islands on the plane is the Isle
of Dread. The island is connected to the Material Plane
by means of a regular storm that sweeps over the island.

CHAPTER 2 I CREATING A MULTIVERSE
   Stygia is also home to its previous ruler, the
serpentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed
by Asmodeus to allow the imprisoned Levistus
to regain his rule. Geryon's fall from grace has
s purred much debate within the infernal courts. No
one is certain whether Asmodeus had some secret
cause to dismiss the archdevi l or whether he is testing
Geryon's allegiance for some greater purpose.
   Malbolge. Malbolge, the sixth layer, has outlasted
many rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countess
and the archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell out of favor and
was struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while
her predecessor, Moloch, still lingers somewhere on
the sixth layer as an imp, plotting to regain Asmodeus's
favor. Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like the
sides of an impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the
layer break off from time to time, creating deadly and
deafening avalanches of stone. The inhabitants of
.Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves
carved into the mountainside.
   Malbolge's current archduchess is Asmodeus's
daughter, Glasya. She resembles a succubus with
her small horns, leathery wings, and forked tail. She
inherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from
her father. The citadel that serves as her domicile on
the slopes of Malbolge is supported by cracked pillars
and buttresses that are sturdy yet seem on the verge of
collapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth lined with
cells and torture chambers, where Glasya confines and
torments those who displease her.
   Maladomini. The seventh layer, Maladomini, is ruin-
covered wasteland. Dead cities form a desolate urban
landscape, and between them lie empty quarries,
crumbling roads, slag heaps, the hollow shells of
empty fortresses, and swarms of hungry flies.
   The Archduke of Maladomini is Baalzebul,
the Lord of Flies. A bloated fiend with the lower
body of an enormous slug, Baalzebul's form was
in flicted on him by Asmodeus as punishment for
wavering loyalty. Baalzebul is a miserable and
degenerate monstrosity who has long conspired to
usurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries
a curse that causes any deal made with him to lead to
ca lamity. Asmodeus occasionally shows Baalzebul favor
fo r reasons no other archduke can fathom , though some
suspect that the Archduke of Ness us still respects the
worthiness of this fallen adversary.
   Cania. Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells, is
an icy hellscape, whose ice storms can tear flesh from
bone. Cities embedded in the ice provide shelter for
guests and prisoners of Cania's ruler, the brilliant and
conniving archdevil Mephistopheles.
   Mephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar,
where he plots to seize the Throne of Baator and
conquer the planes. He is Asmodeus's greatest enemy
and ally, and the Archduke of Ness us appears to
trust Mephistopheles's counsel when it is offered.
Mephistopheles knows he can't depose Asmodeus until
his adversary makes a grave miscalculation, and so
both wait to see what circumstances might turn them
     against each other. Mephistopheles is also a godfather of      MECHANUS

medium , hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember
that groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than
their base XP values would indicate (see step 4).
   For example, using the party from step 2, you can
build a medium encounter by making sure that the
adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP
(the party's threshold for a medium encounter) and
no more than 825 XP (the party's threshold for a hard
encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such
as a manticore or owl bear) is worth 700 XP, so that's
one possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each
one will count for 1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of
dire wolves (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP
value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the
party as well.
   To assist with this approach, appendix B presents a
list of all monsters in the Monster Manual organized by
challenge rating.

THE ADVENTURING DAY
Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average
luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six
to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the
adventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers
can get through more. If it has more deadly encounters,
they can handle fewer.
  In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an
encounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and
other opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how
far the party is likely to progress.
  For each character in the party, use the Adventuring
Day XP table to estimate how much XP that character is
expected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all
party members to get a total for the party's adventuring
day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP
value for encounters the party can handle before the
characters will need to take a long rest.

SHORT RESTS
In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the
party will likely need to take two short rests, about one-
third and two-thirds of the way through the day.

Strongholds provide the local population with protection
in times of trouble. The number of strongholds in an
area depends on the dominant society, the population ,
the strategic importance or vulnerability of the region,
and the wealth of the land.

  Crew. A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to

hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum
number of ski lled hirelings needed to crew a ship
depends on the type of vessel , as shown in the Airborne
and Waterborne Vehicles table.
  You can track the loyalty of individual crew members
or the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules
in chapter 4. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal
during a voyage, the crew turns hostile and stages a
mutiny. If the ship is berthed , disloyal crew members
leave the ship and never return.
  Passengers. The table indicates the number of Small
and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate.
Accommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight
quarters. A ship outfitted with private accommodations
can carry one-fifth as many passengers.
  A passenger is usually expected to pay 5 sp per day
for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A
 mall private cabin usually costs 2 gp per day.
  Cargo. The table indicates the maximum tonnage
each kind of ship can carry.
  Damage Threshold. A ship has immunity to all
damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or
greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes
damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or
exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial
and doesn't reduce the ship's hit points.
  Ship Repair. Repairs to a damaged ship can be made
. hile the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of
 amage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials
and labor.

action to speak the flask's command word, targeting a
creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the
target is native to a plane of existence other than the one
you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has
been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the
saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the
flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature
at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to
breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.
   You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper
and release the creature the flask contains. The creature
is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and
obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no
commands or give it a command that is likely to result
in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no
actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in
accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.
   An identify spell reveals that a creature is inside
the flask, but the only way to determine the type of
creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle
might already contain a creature chosen by the DM or
determined randomly.

jAV ELIN OF LIGHTNING
Weapon (javelin), uncommon
This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and
speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of
lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out
from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in
the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13
Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on
a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful
one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when
it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack
against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage
from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.
   The javelin's property can't be used again until the
next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used
as a magic weapon.

                            taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
                            saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the
                            creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your
                            next turn.
                              While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a

   To create a golem, you must spend the time s hown on
the table, working without interruption with the ma nu al
at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You
must also pay the specified cost to purchase s upplies.
   Once you finish creating the golem, the book is
consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes
an imate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on
it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys
your spoken commands. See the Monster Ma nual for its
game statistics.

M ANUAL OF QUICKNESS OF ACTION
Wondrous item, very rare
This book contains coordination and balance exercises,
and its words are charged with magic. If you spend
48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying

Dexterity score increases by 2 , as does your maximum

equal to your walking speed. In addition, whenever you                           OF THOUGHTS
start your turn underwater with 0 hit points, the armor
causes you to rise 60 feet toward the surface. The armor
is decorated with fish and shell motifs.

M EDALLION OF THOUGHTS
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can
use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the detect
thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion
regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

M IRROR OF LIFE TRAPPING
Wondrous item, very rare
When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its
s urface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror
weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and
vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is
destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.
   If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you
are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its
command word and activate it. It remains activated until
you use an action to speak the command word again.
   Any creature other than you that sees its reflection
in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must
s ucceed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be
trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in
one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This
saving throw is made with advantage if the creature
knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on
the saving throw automatically.
   An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled
with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures
trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't
                                                                                       QuiCKNESs OF AcTION
need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within
a cell can escape using magic that permits planar
travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell

R oD OF ABSORPTIO N
Rod, very rare (requires attunement)
While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to
absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an
area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled,
and the spell's energy- not the spell itself- is stored in
the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when
it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels
of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod
                                                                        RoBE oF

are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod
has no effect on that spell.
   When you become attuned to the rod, you know how
ma ny levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the
course of its existence, and how many levels of spell
energy it currently has stored.
   If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can
convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells
you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots

                                        This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic
                                        mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage roll
                                        made with it. The rod has properties associated with si.:_
                                        different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It
                                        has three other properties as well, detailed below.
                                          Six Buttons. You can press one of the rod's six
                                        buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until
                                        you push a different button or until you push the same
                                        button again, which causes the rod to revert to its
                                        normal form.

                                        down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out,
                                        transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants
                                        a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
                                          If you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds
                                        down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the
                                        rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming
                                        the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to
                                        attack and damage rolls made with it.

and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the
exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage
from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the

   The sphere is stationary until someone controls it.
If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere,

direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to
5 x your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a

whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC

   If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another
creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana)

of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.

staff to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by
the snake.
   On your turn, you can mentally command the snake
if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated.
You decide what action the snake takes and where it
moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general
command, such as to attack your enemies or guard
a location.
   If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and
reverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is
destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing

Staff, rare (requires attunement by a druid)
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that
grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made
with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus to spell
attack rolls.
   The staff has 10 charges for the following properties.
It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.
If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the
staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical
quarterstaff.
   Spells. You can use an action to expend 1 or more
of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells
from it, using your spell save DC: animal friendship (1
charge), awaken (5 charges), barkskin (2 charges), locate
animals or plants (2 charges), speak with animals (1
charge), speak with plants (3 charges), or wall of thorns
(6 charges).
   You can also use an action to cast the pass without
trace spell from the staff without using any charges.
   Tree Form. You can use an action to plant one end
of the staff in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to
transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet
tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at
the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears
ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation
magic if targeted by detect magic. While touching the
tree and using another action to speak its command ,
word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any
creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.

STAFF OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING
Staff, very rare (requires attunement)
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that

until the next dawn.

                                                 audible out to 300 feet. The target you hit must succeed

                                                 This staff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended

                                                   The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On

can be undone. Learning this weakness might require
extensive research or the successful completion of a
quest. The DM decides how a particular artifact can be
destroyed. Some suggestions are provided here:
  The artifact must be melted down in the volcano,
  forge, or crucible in which it was created.
  The artifact must be dropped into the River Styx.
  The artifact must be swallowed and digested by the
  tarrasque or some other ancient creature.
  The artifact must be bathed in the blood of a god
  or an angel.
  The artifact must be struck and shattered by a special
  weapon crafted for that purpose.
  The artifact must be pulverized between the titanic
  gears of Mechanus.
  The artifact must be returned to its creator, who can
  destroy it by touch.

 The Book ofVile Darkness touches on every evil in the
 cosmos. A character can use th e lore the book contains
 to unearth terrib le secrets no morta l shoul d know. Among
 the contents a character might fi nd are the following, plus
 whatever else you choose:
   Vile Apotheosis . The book could hold a ritual that allows a
   character to become a lich or death knight.
   True Names. The true names of any number of fiends
   might be in the book.
   Dark Magic. Several spells of horrific evil of the OM's
   design and choosing could be in the book. Spells could
   impose dreadful curses, disfigure others, require human
   sacrifice, afflict creatures with crippling pain, spread vile
   plagues, and so on .


  A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours

  The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only
as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you
fail to perform at least one evil act within the span
of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the
book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book,
an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be
restored to life by any means while your soul remains

CHAPTER 7 I TREASURE
  A letter of recommendation is worth only as much as
the person who wrote it and offer no benefit in places
where its writer holds no sway.

MEDALS
Although they are often fash ioned from gold and
other precious materials, medals have an even greater
symbolic value to those who awa rd and receive them.
   Medals are typically awarded by powerful political
figures for acts of heroism , a nd wearing a medal
is usually enough to earn the respect of those who
understand its significance.
   Different acts of heroism can warrant different
kinds of medals. The King of Breland (in the Eberron
campaign setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor
(shaped like a shield and made of ruby and electrum)
to adventurers for defending Brei ish citizens, while
the Golden Bear of Breland (a medal made of gold and
shaped in a likeness of a bear's head, with gems for
eyes) might be reserved for adventurers who prove their
allegiance to the Brelish Crown by uncovering and
defeating a plot to end the Treaty of Thronehold and
reignite the Last War.
  A medal doesn't offer a specific in-game benefit to one
who wears it, but it can affect dealings with NPCs. For
example, a character who proudly displays the Golden
Bear of Breland will be regarded as a hero of the people
within the kingdom of Breland. Outside Breland, the
medal carries far less weight, except among allies of
Breland's king.

PARCELS OF LAND
A parcel of land is just that, and usually comes with a
royal letter affirming that the land has been granted as a
reward for some service. Such land usually remains the
property of the local ruler or ruling body, but is leased
to a character with the understanding that it can be
taken away, especially if his or her loyalty is ever called
into question.
  A parcel of land, if sufficiently large, might have one or
more farms or villages on it already, in which case the
recipient is pronounced lord or lady of the land and is
expected to collect taxes, along with any other duties.
  A character who receives a parcel of land is free to
build on it and is expected to safeguard it. He or she may
yield the land as part of an inheritance, but can't sell
or trade it without permission from the local ruler or
ruling body.
  Parcels of land make fine rewards for adventurers
who are looking for a place to settle or who have family
or some kind of personal investment in the region where
the land is located.

SPECIAL FAVORS
A reward might come in the form of a favor that the
characters can call on at some future date. Special
favors work best when the individual granting them is
trustworthy. A lawful good or lawful neutral NPC will
do whatever can be done to fulfill an obligation when
the time comes, short of breaking laws. A lawful evil
NPC does the same, but only because a deal is a deal.
A neutral good or neutral PC might pay off favors to
protect his or her reputation. A chaotic good NPC is

TRAINING
A character might be offered pecial training in lieu of
a financial reward. This kind of training isn't widely
available and thus is highly desirable. It presu mes
the existence of a skilled trainer-perhaps a retired
adventurer or champion who is willing to serve as a
mentor. The trainer might be a reclusive wizard or
haughty sorcerer who owes the queen a favor, the
knight-commander of the King's Guard, the leader of
a powerful druid circle, a quirky monk who lives in a
remote mountaintop pagoda, a barbarian chieftain , a
warlock living among nomads as a fo rtune-teller, or an
absentminded bard whose plays and poetry are known
throughout the land.
  A character who agrees to training as a reward must
spend downtime with the trainer (see chapter 6 for
more information on downtime activities). In exchange,
the character is guaranteed to receive a special benefit.
Possible training benefits include the following:
  The character gains inspiration daily at dawn for
  ld4 + 6 days.
• The character gains proficiency in a skill.
  The character gains a feat.

EPIC BOONS
An epic boon is a special power available only to 20th
level characters. Characters at that level gain such
boons only if you want them to and only when you feel
it's appropriate. Epic boons are best awarded after
the characters complete a major quest, or accomplish
something else particularly notable. A character might
gain an epic boon after destroying an evil artifact,
defeating an ancient dragon, or halting an incursion
from the Outer Planes.
   Epic boons can also be used as a form of
advancement, a way to provide greater power to
characters who have no more levels to gain. With this
approach, consider awarding one epic boon to each
character for every 30,000 XP he or she earns above
355,000 XP.
   You determine which epic boon a character gains.
Ideally, the boon you pick is something the character
would put to use in future adventures. You can allow a
player to select a boon for his or her character, subject to   •


                                                               •••
your approval.
   Whatever boon a character ends up with, consider its
place in your story and world. Many of the boons are
extraordinary and represent the gradual transformation
of a character into something resembling a demigod.
The acquisition of a boon might visibly transform a
character. For example, the eyes of a character with
the Boon of True sight might glow when he or she feels
strong emotion, and a character who has the Boon of
High Magic might have faint motes of light glimmering
around his or her head. Also, decide how the boon first
appears. Does the boon appear spontaneously and
mysteriously? Or does a being of cosmic power manifest
to bestow it? The bestowal of a boon can itself be an
exciting scene in an adventure.
   The text of a boon addresses its user. Unless a boon
says otherwise, a character can't gain it more than once.

    to the ga me and immersing themselves in
    its world.
       Remember that dice don't run your
    game- you do. Dice are like rules. They're
    tools to help keep the action moving. At any
    time, you can decide that a player's action is
    automatically successful. You can also grant
    the player advantage on any ability check,
    reducing the chance of a bad die roll foiling the
    character's plans. By the same token, a bad plan
    or unfortunate circumstances can transform the
    easiest task into an impossibility, or at least impose
    disadvantage.

    USING ABILITY SCORES
    When a player wants to do something, it's often
    appropriate to let the attempt succeed without a roll
    or a reference to the character's ability scores. For
    example, a character doesn't normally need to make
    a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room or a
    Charisma check to order a mug of ale. Only call for a
    roll if there is a meaningful consequence for failure.
      When deciding whether to use a roll, ask yourself two
    questions:
      Is a task so easy and so free of conflict and stress that
      there should be no chance of failure?
      Is a task so inappropriate or impossible- such as
      hitting the moon with an arrow-that it can't work?
    If the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind
    of roll is appropriate. The following sections provide                                                                                       •

ENDING A CHASE
A chase ends when one s ide or the other tops, when the
quarry escapes, or when the pursuer are close enough
to their quarry to catch it.
  If neither side gives up the cha e. the quarry ma kes a
Dexterity (Stealth) check at the end of each rou nd, after
every participant in the chase ha taken its tu rn. The
result is compared to the passive\ isdom (Perception)
scores of the pursuers. If the quarry consists of multiple
creatures, they all make the check.
  If the quarry is never out of the lead pursuer's sight,
the check fails automatically. Otherwise, if the result of
the quarry's check is greater tha n the highest passive
score, that quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues
for another round.
  The quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on its
check based on prevailing circumstances , as shown in
the Escape Factors table. If one or more factors give the
quarry both advantage and disadvantage on its check,
the quarry has neither, as usual.

EscAPE FACTORS
Factor                                      Check Has ...
Quarry has many things to hide behind       Advantage
Quarry is in a very crowded or noisy area   Advantage
Quarry has few things to hide behind        Disadvantage
Quarry is in an uncrowded or quiet area     Disadvantage
The lead pursuer is a ranger or has         Disadvantage
proficiency in Survival

   Other factors might help or hinder the quarry's ability
to escape, at your discretion. For example, a quarry with
a faerie fire spell cast on it might have disadvantage on
checks made to escape because it's much easier to spot.
   Escape doesn't necessarily mean the quarry has
outpaced its pursuers. For example, in an urban
setting, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a
crowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to
where it went.

CHASE COMPLICATIONS
As with any good chase scene, complications can arise
to make a chase more pulse-pounding. The Urban
Chase Complications table and the Wilderness Chase
Complications table provide several examples.
  Complications occur randomly. Each participant in
the chase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the
appropriate table to determine whether a complication
occurs. If it does, it affects the next chase participant in
the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the
die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant
affected by the complication can spend inspiration to
negate the complication.

DISEASES
A plague ravages the kingdom , setting the adventurers
on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from
an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon
finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock
offends some dark power and contracts a strange
affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.
  A simple outbreak might amount to little more than
a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting
of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can
form the basis of one or more adventures as characters
search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and
deal with the consequences.
  A disease that does more than infect a few party
members is primarily a plot device. The rules help
describe the effects of the disease and how it can be
cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't
bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect
any creature, and a given illness might or might not
pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A
plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep
through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races
untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.

CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME
the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the
adventurers face.

GOING MAD
Various magical effects can inflict madness on an
otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact
other plane a nd symbol, can cause insanity, a nd you can
use the madness rules here instead of the s pell effects
in the Player 's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar
effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of
Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts
can a lso break the psyche of a character who uses or
becomes attuned to them.
  Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires
a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game
includes the Sanity score (see chapter 9, "Dungeon
Master's Workshop"), a creature makes a Sanity saving
throw instead.

MADNESS EFFECTS
                              -----
Madness can be short-term, long-term , or indefinite.
Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term
madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More
horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-
term or indefin ite madness.
  A cha racter a ffl icted with short-term madness is
subjected to a n effect from the Short-Term Madness
table for ldlO minutes.
  A charac ter a fflicted with long-term madness is
subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness
table for ldlO x 10 hours.
  A character afflicted with indefinite madness gains
a new character fl aw from the Indefinite Madness table
that lasts until cured.

SHORT-TERM MADNESS

           takes any damage.
 21-30     The character becomes incapacitated and spends
           the duration screaming, laughing, or weeping.
 31 - 40   The character becomes frightened and must use
           his or her action and movement each round to flee
           from the source of the fear.
 41 - 50   The character begins babbling and is incapable of
           normal speech or spellcasting.
 51 - 60   The character must use his or her action each
           round to attack the nearest creature.
 61-70     The character experiences vivid hallucinations and

CHAPTER 8 I RUNNING THE GAME
NONCOMBAT CHALLE .. GES
                                           ------:-
You decide whether to award experience to characters
for overcoming challenges out ide combat. If the
adventurers complete a ten e negotiation with a baron ,
forge a trade agreement with a clan of surly dwa rves,
or successfully navigate the Chasm of Doom , yo u might
decide that they deserve an XP rewa rd.
   As a starting point, use the rules fo r building combat
encounters in chapter 3 to gauge the difficulty of the
challenge. Then award the cha racters XP as if it had
been a combat encounter of the same difficulty, but only
if the encounter involved a meaningful risk of fa ilure.

MILESTONES
You can also award XP when characters complete
significant milestones. When preparing your adventure,
designate certain events or challenges as milestones, as
with the following exampl es:
  Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to
  complete the adventure.
  Discovering a hidden location or piece of information
  relevant to the adventure.
  Reaching an important destination.
  When awarding XP, treat a major milestone as a hard
encounter and a minor milestone as an easy encounter.
  If you want to reward your players for their progress
through an adventure with something more than XP
and treasure, give them additional small rewards at
milestone points. Here are some examples:
  The adventurers gain the benefit of a short rest.
  Characters can recover a Hit Die or a low-level
  spell slot.
  Characters can regain the use of magic items that
  have had their limited uses expended.

LEVEL ADVANCEMENT WITHOUT XP
You can do away with experience points entirely and
control the rate of character advancement. Advance
characters based on how many sessions they play, or
when they accomplish significant story goals in the
campaign. In either case, you tell the players when their
characters gain a level.
  This method of level advancement can be particularly
helpful if your campaign doesn't include much
combat, or includes so much combat that tracking XP
becomes tiresome.

SESSION- BASED ADVANCEMENT
A good rate of session-based advancement is to have
characters reach 2nd level after the first session of play,
3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two
more sessions. Then spend two or three sessions for
each subsequent level. This rate mirrors the standard
rate of advancement, assuming sessions are about four
hours long.

STORY- BASED ADVANCEMENT
When you let the story of the campaign drive
advancement, you award levels when adventurers
accomplish significant goals in the campaign.

  Honor Checks. Honor checks can be used in social
situations, much as Charisma would, when a character's
understanding of a code of conduct is the most defining
factor in the way a social interaction will play out.
  You might also call for an Honor check when a
character is in one of the following situations:
  Being unsure how to act with honor
• Surrendering while trying to save face
  Trying to determine another character's Honor score
  Trying to use the proper etiquette in a delicate
  social situation
  Using his or her honorable or dishonorable reputation
  to influence someone else
  Honor Saving Throws. An Honor saving throw
comes into play when you want to determine whether
a character might inadvertently do something
dishonorable. You might call for an Honor saving throw
in the following situations:
  Avoiding an accidental breach of honor or etiquette
  Resisting the urge to respond to goading or insults
  from an enemy
  Recognizing when an enemy attempts to trick a
  character into a breach of honor

SANITY ScoRE
Consider using the Sanity score if your campaign
revolves around entities of an utterly alien and
unspeakable nature, such as Great Cthulhu , whose
powers and minions can shatter a character's mind.
   A character with a high Sanity is level-headed even in
the face of insane circumstances, while a character with
low Sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted
by eldritch horrors that are beyond norma l reason.
  Sanity Checks. You might ask cha racters to make a
Sanity check in place of an Intelligence check to recall
lore about the alien creatures of madness featured
in your campaign, to decipher the writings of raving
lunatics, or to learn spells from tomes of forbidden lore.
You might also call for a Sanity check when a character
tries one of the following activities:
  Deciphering a piece of text written in a la nguage so
  alien that it threatens to break a character's mind
  Overcoming the lingering effects of madness
• Comprehending a piece of alien magic foreign to all
  normal understanding of magic

                                        The rules for fear and horror can help you sustain an
                                        atmosphere of dread in a dark fantasy campaign.

                                        FEAR

                                        ending the effect on the character on a successful save.

                                        HORROR
                                        Horror involves more than simple fright. It entails
                                        revulsion and anguish. Often it arises when adventurer
                                        see something completely contrary to the common

                                          In such a situation , you can call on characters to make

CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP
PLOT POINTS
Plot points allow players to change the course of the
campaign, introduce plot complications, alter the
world, and even assume the role of the DM. If your first
reaction to reading this optional rule is to worry that
your players might abuse it, it's probably not for you.

USING PLOT POINTS
Each player starts with 1 plot point. During a session,
a player can spend that point for one effect. The effect
depends on your group's approach to this optional rule.
Three options are presented below.
  A player can spend no more than 1 plot point
per session. You can increase this limit if you like,
especially if you want the players to drive more of the
story. Once every player at the table has spent a plot
point, they each gain 1 plot point.

OPTION 1: WHAT A TWIST!
A player who spends a plot point gets to add some
element to the setting or situation that the group
(including you) must accept as true. For example, a
player can spend a plot point and state that his or her
character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or
a monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed
into a horrid beast.
  A player who wants to spend a plot point in this way
should take a minute to discuss his or her idea with
everyone else at the table and get feedback before
settling on a plot development.

OPTION 2: THE PLOT THICKENS
Whenever a player spends a plot point, the player to his
or her right must add a complication to the scene. For
example, if the player who spends the plot point decides
that her character has found a secret door, the player
to the right might state that opening the door triggers a
magical trap that teleports the party to another part of
the dungeon.

OPTION 3: THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY
With this approach, there is no permanent DM.
Everyone makes a character, and one person starts as
the DM and runs the game as normal. That person's
character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the
group or remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes.
  At any time, a player can spend a plot point to become
the DM. That player's character becomes an NPC, and
play continues. It's probably not a good idea to swap
roles in the middle of combat, but it ca n happen if your
group allows time for the new DM to settle into his or
her role and pick up where the previous DM left off.
  Using plot points in this way can make for an
exciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in
unexpected directions. This approach is also a great
way for would-be DMs to try running a game in small,
controlled doses.
  In a campaign that uses plot points this way, everyone
should come to the table with a bit of materia l prepared
or specific encounters in mind. A player who isn't
prepared or who doesn't feel like DMing can choose
to not spend a plot point that session.
    For this approach to work, it's a good idea to establish
  some sha red assumptions about the campaign so that
  DMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each
  other's plans.

  COMBAT OPTIONS
  The options in this section provide alternative ways to
  handle combat. The main risk of adding some of these
  rules is slowing down play.

  INITIATIVE VARIANTS
                                  ----
  This section offers different ways to handle initiative.

  INITIATIVE ScoRE
• With this optional rule, creature don't roll initiative
  at the start of combat. Instead, each creature has an
  initiative score, which is a passive Dexterity check:
  10 +Dexterity modifier.
    By cutting down on die rolls, math done on the fly,
  and the process of asking for and recording totals, you
  can speed your game up considerably-at the cost of an
  initiative order that is often predictable.

  SIDE INITIATIVE
  Recording initiative for each PC and monster, arrangi n
  everyone in the correct order, and remembering where
  you are in the list can bog the game down. If you want
  quicker combats, at the risk of those combats becoming
  unbalanced, try using the side initiative rule.
     Under this variant, the players roll a d20 for their
  initiative as a group, or side. You also roll a d20. Neither
  roll receives any modifiers. Whoever rolls highest wins
  initiative. In case of a tie, keep rerolling until the tie
  is broken.
     When it's a side's turn, the members of that side can
  act in any order they choose. Once everyone on the side
  has taken a turn, the other side goes. A round ends
  when both sides have completed their turns.
     If more than two sides take part in a battle, each side
  rolls for initiative. Sides act from the highest roll to
  lowest. Combat continues in the initiative order until the
  battle is complete.
     This variant encourages teamwork and makes your
  life as a DM easier, since you can more easily coordinate
  monsters. On the downside, the side that wins initiative
  can gang up on enemies and take them out before they
  have a chance to act.

  SPEED FACTOR
  Some DMs find the regular progression of initiative
  too predictable and prone to abuse. Players can use
  their knowledge of the initiative order to influence their
  decisions. For example, a badly wounded fighter might
  charge a troll because he knows that the cleric goes
  before the monster a nd can heal him.
    Speed factor is an option for initiative that introduces
  more uncertainty into combat, at the cost of speed of
  play. Under this variant, the participants in a battle roll
  initiative each round. Before rolling, each character or
  monster must choose an action.

                                        well armored, raise its AC accordingly. Don't worry if
                                        the monster's AC isn't matching up with the expected
                                        challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affec·
                                        a monster's challenge rating, as shown in later steps.
                                           Determine an Appropriate AC. Alternatively, you car:
                                        determine an appropriate AC based on the type of arm -
                                        the monster wears, its natural armor, or some other
                                        Armor Class booster (such as the mage armor spell).
                                        Again, don't worry if the monster's AC isn't matching u
                                        with the expected challenge rating for the monster.
                                           If your monster wears manufactured armor, its
                                        Armor Class is based on the type of armor worn (see
                                        the Player's Handbook for armor types). If the monster
                                        carries a shield, apply the shield bonus to its AC
                                        as normal.
                                           A monster that doesn't wear armor might have natur2
                                        armor, in which case it has an AC equal to 10 +its
                                        Dexterity modifier+ its natural armor bonus. A mons£
                                        with a thick hide generally has a natural armor bonu
                                        of +1 to +3. The bonus can be higher if the creature
                                        is exceptionally well armored. A gorgon, for example.
                                        is covered in steely plates and has a natural armor

                                        STEP 8. HIT POINTS
                                        A monster's hit points have a direct bearing on its
                                        challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine y -
                                        monster's hit points in one of two ways.
                                          Use the Table. You can start with the monster's
                                        expected challenge rating and use the Monster
                                        Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an
                                        appropriate number of hit points. The table presents a
                                        range of hit points for each challenge rating.
                                          Assign Hit Dice. Alternatively, you can assign a
                                        number of Hit Dice to a monster, then calculate its
                                        average hit points. Don't worry if the hit points aren t
                                        matching up with the expected challenge rating for the
                                        monster. Other factors can affect a monster's challenge
                                        rating, as shown in later steps, and you can always
                                        adjust a monster's Hit Dice and hit points later on.
                                          A monster can have as many Hit Dice as you want.
                                        but the size of the die used to calculate its hit points
                                        depends on the monster's size, as shown in the Hit Di
                                        by Size table. For example, a Medium monster uses d~:
                                        for hit points, so a Medium monster with 5 Hit Dice ru::-

                                          A monster typically has average hit points based on ·-~
                                        Hit Dice. For example, a creature with 5d8 + 5 hit poi
                                        has an average of 27 hit points (5 x 4.5 + 5).

  CHAPTER 9 I DUNGEON MASTER'S WORKSHOP
  The NPC Features table summarizes the ability
modifiers and features of variou nonh uman races, as
well as various creatures from the Monster Manual with
a challenge rating lower than 1. Apply these modifiers
and add these features to the P Cs stat block, then
determine the NPC's challenge rating just as you would
for a monster. Features that can affect a monster's
challenge rating are listed in the Monster Features table.
The NPC's proficiency bonus is determined by its level,
just like a character, rather than by its challenge rating.
  If the monster you want to use isn't listed on the table,
use the process described below under "Monsters
with Classes."

MONSTERS WITH CLASSES
You can use the rules in chapter 3 of the Player's
Handbook to give class levels to a monster. For example,
you can turn an ordinary werewolf into a werewolf with
four levels of the barbarian class (such a monster would
be expressed as "Werewolf, 4th-level barbarian").
   Start with the monster's stat block. The monster gains
all the class features for every class level you add, with
the following exceptions:
  The monster doesn't gain the starting equipment of
  the added class.
  For each class level you add, the monster gains one
  Hit Die of its normal type (based on its size), ignoring
  the class's Hit Die progression.
  The monster's proficiency bonus is based on its
  challenge rating, not its class levels.
  Once you finish adding class levels to a monster,
feel free to tweak its ability scores as you see fit (for
example, raising the monster's Intelligence score so
that the monster is a more effective wizard), and make
whatever other adjustments are needed. You'll need
to recalculate its challenge rating as though you had
designed the monster from scratch.
  Depending on the monster and the number of class
levels you add to it, its challenge rating might change
very little or increase dramatically. For example, a
werewolf that gains four barbarian levels is a much
greater threat than it was before. In contrast, the hit
points, spells, and other class features that an ancient
red dragon gains from five levels of wizard don't               healing spells, for example, and adding a healing spell
increase its challenge rating.                                  to the wizard class list would step on the cleric's turf.
                                                                                                                            I,

HEALING SPELLS
You can also use the Spell Damage table to determine
how many hit points a hea ling spell restores. A cantrip
shouldn't offer healing.

CREATING A MAGIC ITEM
The magic items in chapter 7, "Treasure," are but a few
of the magic treasures that characters can discover
during their adventures. If your players are seasoned
veterans and you want to surprise them, you can either
modify an existing item or come up with something new.

MODIFYING AN ITEM
The easiest way to invent a new item is to tweak an
existing one. If a paladin uses a flail as her main
weapon, you could change a holy avenger so that it's a
flail instead of a sword. You can turn a ring of the ram
into a wand, or a cloak of protection into a circlet of
protection, all without altering the item's properties.
   Other substitutions are equally easy. An item that
deals damage of one type can easily deal damage of
another type. A flame tongue sword could deal lightning
damage instead of fire , for example. One capability
can replace another, so a potion of climbing can easily
become a potion of stealth.
   You can also modify an item by fusing it with
properties from another item. For example, you could
combine the effects of a helm of comprehending
languages with those of a helm of telepathy into a
single helmet. This makes the item more powerful
(and probably increases its rarity), but it won't break
your game.
   Finally, remember the tools that are provided for
modifying items in chapter 7, "Treasure." Giving an item
an interesting minor property, a quirk, or sentience can
alter its flavor significantly.

CREATING A NEW ITEM
If modifying an item doesn't quite do the trick, you can
create one from scratch. A magic item should either let a
character do something he or she couldn't do before, or
improve the character's ability to do something he or she
can do already. For exa mple, the ring ofjumping lets its
wearer jump greater dista nces , thus augmenting what
a character can already do. A ring of the ram , however,
gives a character the ability to deal force damage.
