This is a practical cheat sheet to help quickly create or modify NPCs during a session.

## Quick NPC Creation Flow

1. **Decide role & power level**  
   → What does the NPC *do* in the story?  
   → What Challenge Rating (CR) feels right for the party?

   | Party Level | Typical NPC CR Range      | Examples                              |
   |-------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
   | 1–4         | 0 – 2                      | Commoner, Guard, Bandit, Acolyte      |
   | 5–10        | 2 – 6                      | Knight, Priest, Mage, Gladiator       |
   | 11–16       | 6 – 12                     | Veteran, Assassin, Archmage           |
   | 17+         | 8 – 12+ (with magic items) | Archmage + legendary gear, custom CR  |

2. **Pick a base stat block** (most useful ones sorted by rough power)

   | CR   | Name              | Role / Archetype                          | Key Strengths                          |
   |------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
   | 0    | Commoner          | Normal person                             | Basically zero combat value            |
   | 1/8  | Guard / Bandit    | Basic soldier / thug                      | AC 16 / simple weapons                 |

## Quick Power Scaling Tips

- **+1 CR rough guideline** ≈ double HP or +4 damage/round or +2 AC or better action economy
- Most humanoids die fast → give them **one good trick** (Assassinate, Spirit Guardians, Leadership, Globe of Invulnerability)
- **Action Economy is king** → minions + strong leader > single strong monster
- **Magic items are the easiest CR boosters** — a +2 weapon + Cloak of Protection on a Veteran can easily push it to CR 5-6

- **Village Priest** → Priest base, swap Spirit Guardians for Mass Healing Word
