**Notes for AI DM**  
- **Customization:** Add racial traits (e.g., halfling’s Lucky), swap spells (same level, same list), or equip magic items (e.g., *+1 weapon*). Check *Dungeon Master’s Guide* for CR adjustments.  
- **Roleplay Hooks:** Pair with motivations (e.g., greed, revenge) or quirks (e.g., fidgets with holy symbol) from the NPC Creation Guide.  
- **Encounter Building:** Use low-CR NPCs (Commoner, Guard) as minions, mid-CR (Knight, Mage) as lieutenants, and high-CR (Archmage, Assassin) as bosses.  

Happy adventuring! 🐉
